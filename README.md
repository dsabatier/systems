# Systems

## What is this?

This is a suite of services and modules for building data-driven games in unity.  Games need a variety of complex systems communicating with each other.  These systems can quickly become coupled and difficult to iterate on.

By following a simple paradigm game systems are kept separate from data.  Their relationships are clearly defined and treated as first-class.

## Prove it

I'm working on some sample implementations, which is part of the process of building up a library of modules that will serve as examples of how to extend the framework, or starting points for new projects.  The first module is a set of classes for building an in-game economy, which will be used to create a crafting game about running a restaurant.  You can look at a nearly-function cooking minigame in the Samples folder (but I don't yet recommend it :))
