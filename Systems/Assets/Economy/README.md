# Economy

## What is this?

A collections of tools to help create and manage a collection of systems in your game.  These can be extended to create resource management mechanics, shops and crafting systems, relationship simulators, player stats and more and have all of those systems communicate with each other in a way that is easy to understand and iterate on.

At the design-level your systems then have their relationships defined through a refinement process, which is enforced at the code-level with (https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)[adapter interfaces].  These adapters can be varied, complex and constantly changing while keeping each system fully encapsulated.
