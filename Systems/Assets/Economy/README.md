## What is this?

A collections of tools to help create and manage a collection of systems in your game.  These can be extended to create resource management mechanics, shops, crafting systems.  

At the design-level your systems then have their relationships defined through a refinement process, which is enforced at the code-level with (https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)[adapter interfaces].  These adapters can be varied, complex and constantly changing while keeping each system fully encapsulated.
